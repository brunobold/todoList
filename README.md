A simple todo app built in React Native that I spent an evening on. 

Feel free to use my source for your own uses, not that I'd reccomend it as this was my first React Native app that I've made so the code is a little janky. 

**I don't intend on maintaing this project as this was just meant to be practise to learn the basics of React, instead I will be working on a newer revamped todo app (inspired off Notion), so I would strongly reccomend that you would use the source of that project rather than this one for your own use.**
